# DolphinNetworks
A research project on dolphin communication networks

To run the simulation:
1. Download dolphin_networks.R, ConfigurationModel.R, NetworkPropertyFunctions.R, and MarkovChainMC.R to a local folder
2. Run dolphin_networks.R

Configuration model check in dolphin_network.R is incomplete, but provides a glimpse into the accuracy of the test. This particular test takes a long time due to the randomization and selection criteria of the configuration model.
